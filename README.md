# myFirstRepo
Hello GitHub world!
This is my first repository that I've ever created(hopefully not the last one)

And I share with you a simple project that I did Wich took a little bit of time.

Considering my level at web development, I see this as one of the best projects websites I built üòç

I hope that if anyone sees this to tell me my mistakes and hopefully I will correct them.

I accept all the criticism.

The main files are named "Company X"

The other ones are the images I used, and FontAwesome library.

I hope that you guys like it ‚ù§Ô∏è
